The Arduino code for the system hardware operates the slave to the python GUI in a Master-slave architecture, carrying out functions only when instructed to via serial communication.

Contents:
    - ARCaDIUS_Demo: A complete example module with every hardware component attatched.
    - Classes:  each hardware component class.
    - Modules: Modules used in the final demonstration 2023
    - Tests: Arduino Builds of code used for testing components 

To create a module you require:
    - Arcadius_Demo
    - Arcadius_Serial
    - Component classes for required pumps, valves, sensors, etc.
